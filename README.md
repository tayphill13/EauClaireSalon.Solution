## Software/Installation Requirements
* Install [Git v2.62.2+](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* Install [.NET version 3.1 SDK v2.2+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Install [MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)


## Setup ðŸ’»

Copy this url to clone this project to your local system using computer's Command Line terminal: 
```https://github.com/tayphill13/EauClaireSalon.Solutiuon.git```

If you wish to edit the code base: Open the project in your code editor; with Bash, this is done by navigating to the project directory `cd EauClaireSalon.Solution`, then `code .`


## Database Setup/Migration

* Run MySQL by entering ```mysql -uroot -pepicodus``` in the terminal (In this example, 'epicodus' is the password, so if the word `child` was your password then you'd have ```msql -uroot -pchild```)
* Directly import the file taylor_phillips.sql file included in the project into your SQL management tool.
* You can use the SQL query below in your SQL management tool to execute the schema creation yourself:

```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `taylor_phillips`;
CREATE DATABASE `taylor_phillips`;

USE `taylor_phillips`;

CREATE TABLE `Clients` (
  `ClientId` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `StylistId` int DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ClientId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=13 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

CREATE TABLE `Stylists` (
  `StylistId` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Specialty` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`StylistId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=9 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

* If you are using mysql workbench then the database can be generated by importing `taylor_phillips.sql` located in the `EauClaireSalon.Solution` directory.
* This can be found in the MySql Workbench `Server` menu as `Data Import`, then choose `Import from Self-Contained File`.  Use the browsing tool to select the `taylor_phillips.sql` file that is included with the project and finally select `Start Import`.
